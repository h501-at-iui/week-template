There are two types of exercise in this course:

- autograded
- exploratory *(optional)*

**You are expected to complete all of the autograded exercises**, as these are the only ones that will be checked by the autograder and reviewed by the TA. **Exploratory exercises (or "explorations") are optional**, and responses for these will only be reviewed upon request.

Only update the files listed in the exercises themselves. Changing any other file may affect your autograder feedback.
